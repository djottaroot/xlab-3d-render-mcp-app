# 3D Architectural Render MCP App

A high-performance, aesthetically pleasing 3D architectural rendering application built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This app allows AI agents to generate, manipulate, and visualize 3D scenes using simple primitives through a streamlined communication bridge.

## ✨ Features

- **Progressive 3D Rendering**: Real-time visualization of architectural scenes using Three.js.
- **MCP Integration**: Fully compatible with the Model Context Protocol, allowing seamless tool execution and resource management.
- **Cinematic Experience**: Automated and manual camera controls with smooth GSAP animations for professional-grade visualization.
- **Premium UI/UX**: Modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetics with dark/light mode support, leveraging Tailwind CSS and the Outfit typography.
- **State Management**: Robust checkpointing system (Redis/Memory) to save and restore complex 3D scenes.
- **Internationalization**: Full support for English and French locales.
- **Optimized for Vercel**: Ready for serverless deployment with a dedicated API handler.
